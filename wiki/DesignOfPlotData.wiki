= Introduction =

Design notes for the logic behind the actual data plotting script, plot_data.py.

= Details =

This script has a few assumptions and requirements.

Requirements: matplotlib and numpy to be installed.

Assumption:
Data visualized by this script is a csv file containing binary data in the first 1 through n-1 columns, and the last column contains time data. 

It is also assumed that this data has been processed by compress_data.py.  This prepares data to be graphed in a piecewise fashion.

Testing and development is being done with Windows XP using the python 2.7 release available www.python.com.
